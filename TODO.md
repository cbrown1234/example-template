# Ideas

- [] Python env setup with test
- [] Extensions (some in branch)
- [] Changelog generation
- [] Consider postprocessing values from copier answers
- [] Consider custom types for copier answers
- [] Consider previous answers as variables for defaults when changing question structure in later version (easier backwards compatibility) (Need to review issues for relevant existing methods)
